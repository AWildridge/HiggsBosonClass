    "When assessing the uncertainty of a fit, we can not simply use the error of the parameters to compute a 'band of error'. Each parameter is coorelated and their errors as a result are also coorelated. Therefore, we must use statistical analyses to compute these error bands at a certain confidence interval. To illustrate this concept, we will be using the ``TF1`` and ``TVirtualFitter`` classes from ``ROOT``.\n",
